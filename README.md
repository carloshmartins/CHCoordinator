The Swift Package Manager is a tool for managing the distribution of Swift code. It’s integrated with the Swift build system to automate the process of downloading, compiling, and linking dependencies.

## Why is it called CHCoordinator?
Carlos Henrique's Coordinator

## Installing
Make sure Xcode is installed first and then add this SPM via git url inside Xcode, just like any other Package.

Add the following to your Package.swift file's dependencies:

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/carloshmartins/CHCoordinator", from: "1.0.0"),
